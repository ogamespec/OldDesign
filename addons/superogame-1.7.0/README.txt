Description:

SuperOgame is a user javascript for Opera web browser which enhances your Ogame gaming experience.

Installation:

Copy files "SuperOgame_core.js" and "SuperOgame_auser.js" from "SuperOgame" folder to your Opera's user javascript folder. To see which folder it is, open Opera and type opera:about in the address bar, and hit ENTER. Below "Paths" section there's a line "User JavaScript files" which tells where is your user javascript folder located at.
If you don't have user javascript folder set, then type opera:config#UserPrefs|UserJavaScriptFile in the address bar (and hit ENTER), and select a folder for your javascript files. Also make sure option opera:config#UserPrefs|UserJavaScript is ticked.

To install translations simply copy translation file you want from the "Translations" folder to your user javascript folder (along with files "SuperOgame_core.js" and "SuperOgame_auser.js").

"SuperOgame_core.js" 	--> is the core of the SuperOgame and is absolutely required.
"SuperOgame_auser.js" 	--> is where you can define some of the settings which don't have ingame GUI. Just uncomment (remove leading "//") the line and change setting to desired value. This file is optional: if you don't have it default settings (defined in the core file) will be used.

Note: this README file will further updated
